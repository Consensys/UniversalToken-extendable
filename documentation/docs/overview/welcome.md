# Universal Token

The Universal Token is a smart-contract framework for creating customizable tokens. 

Tokens created with the framework are composed of a token contract to which one or multiple extension contracts can be connected. 

The Universal Token is compatible with Ethereum’s most common token standards, including ERC20 and ERC721, with potential support for ERC1155 or ERC1400  

Extensions, deployed on-chain, are reusable across token deployments and standards. 

Extensions can do the following:

* Add external (user-facing) functions to your token.
* Store additional data for your token.
* Listen for token events on-chain such as transfers and approvals.
    - This enables custom functionality for token transfers and other token releated events.

Using the Universal Token API, developers can deploy smart contract extensions. Token contracts can then plug-and-play these extensions, either at token deployment or in real-time on-chain. 

If you want to jump straight into extension building, head over to the [getting started](/getting-started/prerequisites) section.

## Supported token standards

Currently both [ERC20](https://github.com/ConsenSys/UniversalToken-extendable/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol) and [ERC721](https://github.com/ConsenSys/UniversalToken-extendable/blob/main/contracts/ERC721.sol) have implementations that support extensions. 

There are plans to add support for [ERC1400](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/1411) and [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155).
